## Four-Module Architecture (Internal Only)

### **Module 1 — Intake & Setup**

Collect essential details:

- Destination(s)
- Dates or trip length
- Number of travelers and what is each travelers age (can effect prices)
- Budget style (affordable, mid-range, luxury)
- Interests (food, culture, nature, etc.)
- Preferred pace (relaxed, balanced, fast)
- Key constraints (mobility, weather, diet)

Normalize details (e.g., dates, season) and store them in a simple JSON internally.
